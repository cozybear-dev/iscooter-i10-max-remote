# iscooter-i10-max-remote

Remote to use as replacement of iScooter app (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.iscootercar.iscooter&hl=nl).

The app for the iScooter is too slow and sucks, in my humble opinion.

I reversed the app, and translated it into a dirty arduino project.

I use the M5 Atom Lite with the Tailbat.

This repo contains my debug/develop artifacts.

Workflow is as follows;

I single press the tailbat,
turn on my iscooter,
atom lite auto connects within <1 sec,
unlocks the bike, and sets it to sport mode.
optionally, if you single press the atom lite -> it locks.

It automatically turns off at 30s, full shutdown in 60s.
